	// FIX_ME #TRACECACHE
	//
	// Trace Cache Metadata (TCM):
	//
	// If you think about it, a key role of the trace cache is that of a "BTB alternate"
	// for non-sequential fetch bundles.  A T$ hit overrides the BTB and makes the
	// "BTB alternate" take effect for the current fetch bundle.
	//
	// To make the "BTB alternate" analogy clear, we restate the text from the BTB comments section above,
	// and simply replace "BTB's" with "TCM's":
	// "The TCM's information, along with conditional branch T/NT predictions, is critical
	// for determining the fetch bundle's length and for selecting the PC of the next
	// fetch bundle among multiple choices."
	// Note that the TCM will record another piece of metadata, the trace's length.
	// This is a requirement omitted in the MICRO-29 paper (although one could alternatively assume
	// padding with NOPs; however this BPU interface must return a fetch bundle length).
	//
	// The trace cache's other key role is supplying the instructions of the non-sequential fetch bundle,
	// but for simulator efficiency, you don't actually need to have a structure for the instruction trace.
	// I just retooled the existing instruction fetching code in fetch.cc which grabs the instructions
	// from the memory management unit (essentially from the memory image of the program binary).
